# Telegram Stock Sentiment Analysis

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict stock movements by extracting and analyzing social media data from a specified Telegram channel. This involves scraping relevant messages, performing sentiment analysis, extracting key features, and providing insights into potential stock price trends.

## Task Requirements

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Select one platform: Telegram.
   - Scrape relevant data from specific Telegram channels that discuss stock market trends, predictions, or individual stocks.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency (handle missing values, remove noise, etc.).

2. **Data Analysis & Feature Extraction**:
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data to gauge the overall mood (positive/negative/neutral) related to specific stocks.
   - Extract key features such as:
     - Sentiment polarity (e.g., whether discussions around a stock are generally positive or negative).
     - Frequency of mentions for specific stocks or market trends.

3. **Visualization & Reporting**:
   - Create clear visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) that show:
     - Trends in stock sentiment or frequency of mentions over time.
   - Report findings and provide actionable insights.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggest actionable insights based on the analysis, such as potential buy/sell signals based on social media discussions.
   - Recommend future improvements that could enhance the analysis.

## Technical Skills Required

- Proficiency in Python for data scraping (using Telethon for Telegram).
- Strong knowledge of data manipulation and analysis libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- Experience with data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Familiarity with sentiment analysis techniques (using libraries like VADER).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `telethon`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `vaderSentiment`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install telethon pandas matplotlib seaborn vaderSentiment
```

## Setup
#### Telegram API Credentials:

Create a Telegram Developer account to get your API ID and API Hash.
Replace the placeholders in the code (YOUR_API_ID, YOUR_API_HASH, and CHANNEL_USERNAME) with your actual credentials and the username of the channel you want to scrape.
Code:

Ensure you have the complete Python script saved in a .py file (e.g., telegram_stock_analysis.py).
Usage
Run the script using the command line:

```
        python telegram_stock_analysis.py
```
The script will:
Scrape messages from the specified Telegram channel.
Save the scraped messages to a CSV file (telegram_data.csv).
Clean and analyze the data, including performing sentiment analysis.
Generate visualizations for sentiment distribution and message frequency over time.
# Output
Data File: A CSV file named telegram_data.csv containing the scraped messages and their sentiment scores.
# Visualizations:
A histogram showing the distribution of sentiment scores.
A line chart illustrating message frequency over time (if date information is available).

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, you can make actionable insights regarding stock movements and trends. Suggestions for future improvements include:

Integrating data from other sources (e.g., Twitter or financial news).
Using more advanced sentiment analysis techniques.
